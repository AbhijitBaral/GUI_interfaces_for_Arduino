# A descriptive overview of the several tools available for building GUI interfaces for Arduino projects  

The original Arduino IDE provides some very basic GUI capabilties like the Serial Monitor and Serial Plotter,which can be used for displaying text and simple data visualizations. However the facilities provided are very limited and not customizable. Below are a few tools available which fill in what the Arduino IDE doesn't provide.  

* Processing + ControlP5  
<<<<<<< HEAD
    * processing is an open-source graphical library and integrated development environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities. It can communicate with Arduino over serial and create custom GUI.
    * ControlP5 is a processing Library with extra GUI componets like sliders, graphs, buttons, etc.

* Python with PySerial and Tkinter/PyQt
<<<<<<< HEAD
    * PySerial is the Python serial port access library and Tkinter / PyQt both are both Python Libraries for creating GUI applications.
